ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)
Definition:
ARIMA is a popular statistical method for analyzing and forecasting time series data. It models time-dependent data points by combining three components:

AutoRegressive (AR): Incorporates the relationship between an observation and a number of its lagged (past) values.
Integrated (I): Applies differencing to the data to make it stationary (i.e., to remove trends or seasonality).
Moving Average (MA): Uses the dependency between an observation and residual errors from previous time steps.
Applications in Financial Analytics:

Forecasting stock prices or market indices.
Predicting future sales or revenue trends.
Modeling macroeconomic indicators like inflation and unemployment.
Advantages:

Effective for univariate time series forecasting.
Provides clear interpretability of components.
Limitations:

Requires stationary data.
Less effective for datasets with significant external influencing factors or complex patterns.
Regression Analysis
Definition:
Regression analysis is a statistical method used to examine the relationship between dependent (response) and independent (predictor) variables. It predicts the value of the dependent variable based on the predictors.

Types of Regression:
Linear Regression:
Assumes a linear relationship between dependent and independent variables.

Example: Modeling the effect of advertising spend on sales.
Multiple Linear Regression:
Extends linear regression to multiple predictors.

Example: Estimating stock returns using economic indicators like interest rates, inflation, and GDP.
Logistic Regression:
Used when the dependent variable is categorical (e.g., yes/no, 0/1).

Example: Predicting loan default probability.
Polynomial Regression:
Fits a nonlinear relationship by transforming predictors.

Example: Modeling revenue growth that accelerates or decelerates over time.
Ridge/Lasso Regression (Regularization Techniques):
Adds penalty terms to prevent overfitting in models with many predictors.

Applications in Financial Analytics:

Identifying factors influencing stock prices.
Modeling credit risk.
Portfolio optimization and asset pricing.
Advantages:

Versatile and widely applicable.
Easy to interpret and implement.
Limitations:

Assumes a specific relationship (linear or otherwise).
Prone to overfitting if too many predictors are used without regularization.
